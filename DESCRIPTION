Description: Describe a theoretical model expressing the variability observed in the individual growth, such that each individual in the population exhibits a growth pattern with a nonlinear trend toward an expected value. It includes estimation of mean growth increment for the individuals in length class l and the probability of each individual growing from one length class to another over a time-step based on two probabilistic density functions: gamma and normal distributions, also provides some basic plots.
